MVPoly is a multi-variable polynomial algebra library and command interpreter.  It implements the core algebraic functionality to support operations upto and including determining Groebner Basis.  Four monomial orderings are supported: grlex, grevlex, lex, and total degree.  Variable orderings are also supported.  A parser is included as a means to construct a simple command-line interfaces similar to that of Maple.

Version 0.8b is the first releast of MVPoly.  The largest weakness is the Parser.  It needs to be simplified.  The algebra library will be extended as time allows.

To install MVPoly, run the standard sequence:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

The included pod docs have been pre-converted to HTML for you and
placed in the htdocs/ directory. The MVPoly overview (a good place to
start) is in MVPoly.html.
